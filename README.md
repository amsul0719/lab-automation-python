# Computational Bio Learning Portfolio

This repository documents my self-directed training in Python, data analysis,
and computational biology with a focus on building reproducible, portfolio-ready work.

## Structure
- `python-foundations/` — core Python skills (loops, functions, plotting)
- `single-cell/` — future work with pandas, Scanpy, and biological datasets
- `ml-basics/` — introductory machine learning concepts
- `assets/` — figures and supporting files

## Tools
- Python
- JupyterLab
- matplotlib
