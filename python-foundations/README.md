# Translational Biology → Computational Analysis Portfolio

This repository documents my structured progression from experimental neuroscience and small-molecule screening toward computational data analysis and reproducible decision pipelines.

The goal is not simply to learn Python syntax, but to formalize translational biological reasoning into structured, reproducible computational workflows.

## Repository Structure

Each week builds incrementally from foundational Python skills to structured screening logic.

---

## Week 01 - Python Foundations & Data Familiarization

**Focus:** Building core Python fluency and learning to load, inspect, and understand structured biological datasets.

**Skills practiced:**
- Loading CSV files with `pandas`
- Inspecting table structure
- Understanding rows, columns, and data types
- Working with lists and dictionaries

**Biological context:** Experimental datasets must be inspected and understood before interpretation. This week focuses on structured data awareness.

---

## Week 02 - Data Cleaning & Structured Manipulation

**Focus:** Developing confidence in cleaning and organizing experimental datasets for analysis.

**Skills practiced:**
- Subsetting and filtering
- Logical conditions
- Creating calculated columns
- Handling missing values

**Biological context:** Translational datasets require careful preprocessing before meaningful biological conclusions can be drawn.

## Week 03 - Combining Tables for Translational Analysis

**Focus:** Integrating phenotypic screening data with compound metadata.

**Skills practiced:**
- `pd.merge()` for table integration
- `groupby()` for mechanism-level summaries
- Wide ↔ Long reshaping with `pd.melt()`

**Biological context:** Compound annotations (mechanism, target class) must be integrated with phenotypic readouts to support mechanism-based prioritization.

---

## Week 04 - Control Flow & Screening Decision Logic

**Focus:** Translating experimental go/no-go reasoning into structured computational logic.

**Skills practiced:**
- `if / elif / else`
- Logical operators (`and`, `or`)
- `for` loops
- Writing reusable functions
- Building mini screening pipelines

**Biological context:** Compound advancement decisions depend on predefined criteria such as effect size and toxicity. This week formalizes those rules into reproducible Python logic.
